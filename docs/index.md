## Welcome to OSG/PATh Collaboration Support

Our mission is to empower research collaborations by helping teams leverage the services and technologies of the OSG Consortium. With our support, researchers can overcome institutional barriers and access powerful computing and storage resources.

### Simplified Collaboration Access Across Institutions 

Collaborations often involve researchers from multiple institutions, which can create challenges when institutional-specific identities are required. The OSG Collaboration Access Point (Collab AP) resolves this by enabling principal investigators (PIs) to create projects that include members from all participating institutions. This streamlined approach fosters seamless collaboration, allowing teams to:

  * Access the OSPool for launching compute jobs.
  * Utilize multi-terabyte ephemeral storage.
  * Run complex workflows, such as post-processing or job merging, directly on the access point (login node).

To explore the full range of services, visit our services page or reach out to collab-support@osg-htc.org.

### Obtain accounts on OSG's Collab Access Point.

A PI can visit the accounting portal (https://ci-connect.net) sign-up using CI Logon credentials, create a project and add users. A consultation with someone from Collaboration Support is required. A walk through through the process is linked [here](misc/onboard.md). 

## News

11/21/2024

The Open Science Data Platorm (OSDF) origin that was deployed on the OSG Collab AP, ap23.uc.osg-htc.org, has moved to a separate infrastructure to accommodate upgrading to the Pelican data distribution platform and allow for users at other APs use the backend storage. For more details refer to this [section](misc/pelican.md).

04/18/2023 

A new Collab AP host, ap23.uc.osg-htg.org. has been deployed which will replace the existing one, login.collab.ci-connect.net. Users and projects from login.collab.ci-connect.net have moved to the new one. Users are responsible for migrating their data and make any necessary corrections to their workflows. Collaboration Support staff will be available to assist.

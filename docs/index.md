## Mission

The mission of OSG Collaboration Support is to help Midsize Collaborations leverage the OSG Consortium services and technologies for their research.
A list of services can be found [here](misc/services.md). Among them, is provisioning access to an OSG-managed Collab Access Point as a single point of submission of dHTC jobs to the Open Science Pool (OSPool). Users from different institutions can join a collaboration specific project. This simplifies access to compute and storage resources as users are not bound by institutional barriers - such as the need for insitutional based identies. For example Institutions A and B need to work on a project. It is not easy for students/postdocs from Institution A to obtain an identity that will allow them to collaborate with their collegues at the Institution B. On the Collab AP, PIs can create a single project with users from both institutions. This allows for a collaborative environment where the research team can launch jobs to the OSPool, levereage multi-TB ephemeral storage and even run computational workflows - like post-processing or mereging jobs on the access point (the login node). 

### Obtain accounts on OSG's Collab Access Point.

A PI can visit the accounting portal (https://ci-connect.net) sign-up using CI Logon credentials, create a project and add users. A consultation with someone from Collaboration Support is required. A walk through through the process is linked [here](misc/onboard.md). 

## News

11/21/2024

The Open Science Data Platorm (OSDF) origin that was deployed on the OSG Collab AP, ap23.uc.osg-htc.org, has moved to a separate infrastructure to accommodate upgrading to the Pelican data distribution platform and allow for users at other APs use the backend storage. For more details refer to this [section](misc/pelican.md).

04/18/2023 

A new Collab AP host, ap23.uc.osg-htg.org. has been deployed which will replace the existing one, login.collab.ci-connect.net. Users and projects from login.collab.ci-connect.net have moved to the new one. Users are responsible for migrating their data and make any necessary corrections to their workflows. Collaboration Support staff will be available to assist.
